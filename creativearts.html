		<p>Between September 2014 to May 2018, I attended a performing arts high school in Milwaukee, WI (Milwaukee High School of the Arts pictured below). Prior to entering the school, students must audition for their expected majors. I auditioned for the vocal department. Completely bombed the audition and expected not to get into the school (pubescent teen years am I right?)... at least that's what I thought. Received an acceptance letter a few months later following that audition enrolled into the Intermediate Chorale. During freshman and sophomore year, I learned various vocal warm-up exercises, music theory, solfege scales, piano, guitar, songs in Hebrew, Latin, Spanish, African, Hindi Indian, German, French, and Dutch! Moved to Advanced Level Chorale sophomore year! Voice still undergoing several changes-- I went from tenor 1, lowered to tenor 2, lowered once again to bass 2 (lowest of the male voices), and back up to bass 1 (baritone) where I remained for the remainder of my academic time at the school.</p>

		<p>Moving into sophomore year at the Advanced Level required even more work than freshman year. Towards the end of that year, I developed a deep love for acting and modeling. Attempting to bribe my parents into signing me up for a modeling agency, I eventually started acting and modeling with <a href="https://www.jcasablancas.com">John Casablanca's Modeling & Acting Agency.</a> Due to unexpected financial circumstances, I had to stop attending classes. However, that love for acting and modeling did not stop. I left catapulted into a new realm of confidence and self-esteem!</p>

		<p>Moving into junior and senior year, I continued with Advanced Level Chorale as well as enrolled into Opera Workshop, which consisted of acting and singing. Placing ourselves into the stories of: Porgy & Bess play by George Gershwin, Evita musical by Tim Rice , Gospel at Colonus play by Lee Breuer, and 100 Years (R)Evolution of Broadway consisting of many musical numbers from various shows like Rent, Hamilton, The Color Purple, Chicago, Dreamgirls, Kiss Me Kate, The Music Man, and many more! (R)Evolution of Broadway musical consisted of my first few solos portraying an impatient business man in "Rock Island" opening scene from The Music Man and one of the suitors in "Brush Up Your Shakespeare" from Kiss Me Kate.</p>
