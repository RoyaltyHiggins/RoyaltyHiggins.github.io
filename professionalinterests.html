			From September 2016 through May 2018, I worked for a non-profit, all-boys mentoring program <a href="https://www.operation-dream.org">Operation Dream</a> where I worked as the Kindergarten Mentor Assistant Teacher. Tasks included designing and implementing academic curriculums suitable for Kindergarten students, monitoring students progress throughout program duration, offering a supportive, inclusive learning environment, offering mentorship to all program members, and most importantly HAVING FUN! The academic year prior to that I worked in the Cultural Awareness Teaching Department assisting with designing and executing curriculums for program members (first-eighth grade) to help members learn new perspectives, diversity, languages, and culture.
